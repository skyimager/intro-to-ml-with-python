    "Loss functions are computationally feasible loss functions representing the price paid for inaccuracy of prediction.\n",
    "They are quite literally invented, based upon the research and intuition of the investigators who developed them. Sound statistical practice requires selecting an estimator consistent with the  acceptable variation known in the context of an applied problem. Loss functions are selected based on apriori knowledge of the losses that will be experienced from being wrong. This usually amounts to a theoretical argument."

    "### Loss Functions for Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification and regression require different types of loss measures. In particular, classification loss for an individual point is characterized in terms of its a binary measure:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ l_i = y_i \\cdot f(x_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where it is defined that $f(x) \\in \\{-1,1\\}$, a sort of raw binary output rather than specific class label (see the adaboost lecture for another example of this).  It is standard practice to discuss loss functions as functions of only one variable, in order for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0-1 Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The most natural selection for loss would be the 0-1 binary loss function, a function that scores 1 (loss) for an incorrect classification, and 0 for an correct classification. We can formulate it in terms of the [heaviside step function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaviside_step_function):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$l(y_i, f(\\theta,x_i)) = H(-y_i \\cdot f(\\theta,x_i))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, 0-1 is computationally miserable to handle. It's not differentiable and constitutes a computationally intractable problem in terms of formulating a working solution. Instead we substitute surrogate functions that closely mimic the 0-1 function close to inflection points, but are differentiable and convex. (thus optimizable)\n",
